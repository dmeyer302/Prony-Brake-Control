# Prony Brake Control - pronybrake.org
## Arduino-compatible sketch to automate a Prony Brake. Code optimized for Arduino / Teensy 3.5.

User inputs a desired RPM for the brake to turn and a servo on the machine loads or unloads the prime mover until the brake is at that RPM.

Begin with Prony_Brake_Control.ino and be sure the other files get added as Arduino tabs.

## TODO:
* Load cell reading to enable horsepower display
* Excel integration for data logging and display
* Online (MQTT and Node-RED) live display
* PID-controlled motion
